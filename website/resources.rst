Additional Resources
--------------------

This page contains pointers to additional resources and readings that complement what we see in the lectures.

Pintos
~~~~~~

* `Debugging Pintos in Eclipse <pintos_eclipse.html>`_
* `How does thread/process switching work in Pintos? <switch.html>`_

OS Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `OSDev.org <http://wiki.osdev.org/>`_: A very detailed wiki with reference documentation for OS kernel implementors.
  This wiki is a great resource if you need more detailed explanations on how the OS interacts with the x86 architecture,
  as well as many other aspects of implementing an OS.
* Writing a boot loader in Assembly and C: `Part 1 <https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/664165/Writing-a-boot-loader-in-Assembly-and-C-Part>`_ and `Part 2 <https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/668422/Writing-a-boot-loader-in-Assembly-and-C-Part>`_ (found by David Ramsey, OS'2017)  
* `Anatomy of a Program in Memory <http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/anatomy-of-a-program-in-memory/>`_: Detailed explanation
  of how a program is laid out in memory (in 32-bit processors)

x86 Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual - Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1 <http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3a-part-1-manual.html>`_: Contains all the gory details of the x86 (and x86_64) architecture that are relevant to the operating system (most notably, Chapter 4 contains a detailed specification of x86 paging, including a specification of the page tables and their entries).


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `How is a binary executable organized? Let's explore it! <https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/06/how-to-read-an-executable/>`_ and `Dissecting Executable and Linking Format (ELF) <http://www.sw-at.com/blog/2011/04/01/dissecting-executable-and-linking-format-elf/>`_: Two high-level discussions of the ELF file format.
