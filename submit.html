<p>Before you type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>, <strong>take a moment to ensure that this commit is the one you actually want to submit</strong>. In particular, if you follow the instructions in the assignment, but there is an error when committing or pushing (e.g., if you encounter a git merge conflict), you may be submitting an older commit (because the last one you tried to do actually failed). If the commit message and date shown by chisubmit don&#8217;t look right, then you should double-check whether you were able to successfully commit and push your code (a very common mistake is to simply forget to run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code>)</p>
<p>After you type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>, you should see the following message:</p>

<div class="section" id="the-safety-submission-strategy">
<h1>The safety submission strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#the-safety-submission-strategy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Since you can submit as many times as you want before the deadline, a good strategy is to always make a <strong>safety submission</strong> well ahead of the deadline. For example, if an assignment has five tasks, and you have completed four of those tasks but expect to be working on the fifth one right up until the deadline, you should make a submission before you start working on the fifth task. That way, if you end up missing the deadline, there is already a submission in the system with most of your work on it (which may not be as good as a submission with partial or complete work for that fifth task, but still better than not submitting anything at all).</p>
<p><em>Safety submissions are specially important if you have exhausted your extensions. If the deadline passes and you have not made any submissions, and you are out of extensions, that means an automatic zero on that assignment.</em></p>
<p>We also recommend that you plan to make your absolute final submission at least an hour before the deadline, in case there are any issues when you try to submit. If an issue does come up, and you post about it on Piazza with an hour to go, it is very likely that an instructor or a TA will be able to assist you before the deadline. If you wait until three minutes before the deadline to submit, and run into issues, that limits how much assistance we can provide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-extensions">
<h1>Using extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#using-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Please make sure you have read and understood the <a class="reference external" href="syllabus.html#late-submissions">Late submissions</a> section of the syllabus!</p>
<p>If you want to use an extensions, you do not need to ask an instructor for permission and you do not need to notify us of you intention to do so. When you submit, chisubmit will simply determine how many extensions you need to use. For example, if you submit less than 24 hours after the deadline (meaning you only need to use one extensions), chisubmit will include something like this when you run the submission command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Your</span> <span class="n">team</span> <span class="n">currently</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="n">extensions</span>

<span class="n">You</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">going</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">use</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">extensions</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="n">submission</span><span class="o">.</span>

<span class="n">You</span> <span class="n">will</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="n">extensions</span> <span class="n">left</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="n">submission</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To check how many extensions you have left, just run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">chisubmit</span> <span class="n">student</span> <span class="n">course</span> <span class="n">show</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">extensions</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-deadline-grace-period">
<h2>The deadline grace period<a class="headerlink" href="#the-deadline-grace-period" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In every assignment, there will be a <em>very short</em> grace period after the deadline where a submission will not consume an extension. The intent of this grace period is to give some breathing room to students who run into last-minute issues when trying to submit their code (e.g., issues with git). However, you should always aim to submit your code <em>before</em> the deadline, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The length of the grace period is not disclosed, and it will be progressively shorter with each programming assignment.</li>
<li>chisubmit informs the instructors of which students have submitted during the grace period. If we see a team that submits during the grace period for multiple projects, we may begin applying point penalties to any future submissions you make during a grace period.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you submit during the grace period, chisubmit will print the following before you confirm your submission:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">NOTE</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">You</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">submitting</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">deadline</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">instructor</span> <span class="n">has</span>
<span class="n">allowed</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">extra</span> <span class="n">time</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">deadline</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">students</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">submit</span>
<span class="n">without</span> <span class="n">having</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">consume</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">extension</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And the following once you confirm your submission:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Your submission has been completed.

Your submission was made during the deadline&#39;s grace period. This means
that, although your submission was technically made *after* the
deadline, we are counting it as if it had been made before the deadline.

In the future, you should not rely on the presence of this grace period!
Your instructor may choose not to use one in future assignments, or may
use a shorter grace period. Your instructor is also aware of which
submissions are made during the grace period; if you repeatedly submit
during the grace period, your instructor bring this to your attention.
</pre></div>

<div class="section" id="re-submitting-with-an-extensions">
<h1>Re-submitting with an extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#re-submitting-with-an-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As we said earlier, you can re-submit as many times as you want <strong>before the deadline</strong>. Why do we stress &#8220;before the deadline&#8221;? If you make a submission, and the deadline passes, chisubmit flags your submission as being ready for grading, which means the graders might start looking at your submission right away. This is why re-submitting after the deadline is a bit trickier.</p>
<p>If you made a submission before the deadline and realize (before the deadline) that you want to use an extension after all, then you need to cancel your submission. That way, chisubmit will not flag it as ready for grading when the deadline passes. Simply run this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">chisubmit</span> <span class="n">student</span> <span class="n">assignment</span> <span class="n">cancel</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">submit</span> <span class="n">p1a</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>This is your existing submission for assignment p1a:

      Commit: 5b485c80fad76d02df675044b6b4c6c0d32b4ae8
        Date: 2017-01-09 19:17:56
     Message: p1a done! For real! This time!
      Author: Borja Sotomayor &lt;borja@cs.uchicago.edu&gt;

Are you sure you want to cancel this submission? (y/n):  y

Your submission has been cancelled.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that, just re-submit <em>after</em> the deadline, and chisubmit will apply the necessary extensions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you made a submission before the deadline, and then try to either re-submit or cancel the submission <em>after</em> the deadline, chisubmit will not allow you to do this. You will need to ask an instructor to cancel your submission manually, which may involve having to tell the graders to discard any grading they have already done on your submission. This is very inconvenient to the graders, so please try to avoid getting into this situation.</p>
